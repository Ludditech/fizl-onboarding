# Onboarding

Welcome to the GitHub repo of the *Onboarding* project developed by Fizl.

This project aims to provide a practical guide for enriching user experience by creating more immersive and informative interactions through a walkthrough onboarding process. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, we invite you to follow this article in English[^1] or French[^2], which explains in detail how to implement a walkthrough using `Expo`[^3] and `@react-native-masked-view/masked-view`[^4] to guide your users in your React Native applications.

## Guide your users with a walkthrough

ðŸ’š Ludditech, the company behind Fizl, was named in honor of the 19th-century Luddites, who opposed the use of machines for fear of losing their jobs. With this legacy at the heart of our identity, our deep conviction is that technology should not replace workers, but assist them in realizing their potential â€“ to "become what they aspire to be".
